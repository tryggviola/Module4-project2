## Intro

I am (like most people living in Iceland) interested in the weather, that is the first thing that you think about when you wake up, what should I wear, do I need to scrape the ice of my windshield, will I bet too cold or too hot. I decided to create a really simple weather page with just the basic information that you need, nothing too fancy or complicated. 

## The Process

I started by finding a good weather API that was free. I set everything up in <strong>Postman</strong> which is a really good application when it comes to API. Then I created a really simple HTML layout and started working on the JavaScript. Once everything was working I put a basic SASS over everything. 

## The Journey

This is  the first page that I did not create in Figma, I knew I did not want any whistles and bells (plus I am running really behind on the projects) so it is nothing fancy but there are a in my opinion lot of cool features in it and there were a lot of difficulties find out some of them. 

## The Conclusion

API is a must know skill so you can create a website with ever changing data. I liked the the process and I liked learning how to set everything up and working with the data.
